## 1. Executive Summary

Dubai Property 3D World is a next-generation real estate discovery platform purpose-built for the Dubai market. It combines data-driven investment intelligence with photorealistic 3D spatial experiences — enabling investors, brokers, and end-users to evaluate, visualise, and share properties with unprecedented depth.

The platform operates as a three-layer ecosystem:

- A marketing landing web app that contextualises the product and routes users into two analytical tools.
- **Tool 1 — Dubai ROI Wizard:** A rental property ROI, yield, and IRR calculator.
- **Tool 2 — Dubai Prop Pulse:** A market pulse and property analytics dashboard.
- **The Core Product — 3D World Viewer:** Gaussian Splat-based photorealistic 3D property exploration, activated from either tool after a user has identified a property of interest.

The 3D Viewer is the primary differentiator and revenue driver. Once a user completes analysis in either tool, they are offered an immersive 3D walk-through of the property — complete with spatial ROI annotations, cinematic video export for WhatsApp distribution, and AI-powered furnishing overlays.

## 4. Product Architecture

The platform is composed of four distinct but interconnected components. Each can function independently, but the designed user journey flows linearly through them.

### 4.1 Architecture Overview

| Platform Components | |
|---|---|
| **[Layer 1] Landing Web App** | Main entry point, brand hub, tool router |
| **[Layer 2] Tool 1: Dubai ROI Wizard** | Financial analysis (ROI, yield, IRR, cashflow) |
| **[Layer 3] Tool 2: Dubai Prop Pulse** | Market intelligence, area trends, comparable data |
| **[Layer 4] 3D World Viewer** | Gaussian Splat 3D environment, cinematic tours, spatial annotations |

All four layers share a unified session/state system so that data from the tools (selected property, ROI results, market data) flows into the 3D Viewer as contextual overlays without users needing to re-enter information.

### 4.2 Component Responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Landing Web App | Brand presence, SEO, value proposition, tool discovery, user authentication, subscription management. |
| ROI Wizard (Tool 1) | Input property price, rental income, service charges, mortgage rate, holding period. Output: Gross yield, net yield, IRR, cashflow table, break-even analysis. |
| Prop Pulse (Tool 2) | Browse and filter Dubai property market data by area, property type, price range. Show comparable transactions, area growth trends, supply pipeline. |
| 3D World Viewer | Upload property photos → generate Gaussian Splat 3D scene → navigate, annotate, export video, overlay AI furniture, share link. |

---

## 5. User Flows

### 5.1 Primary Flow — Investor Journey

| End-to-End Investor Flow | |
|---|---|
| **Step 1** | User lands on the main web app via SEO, paid ad, or broker referral link. |
| **Step 2** | User browses the landing page (guest access). Presented with three entry points: ROI Wizard, Prop Pulse, and Developer Intelligence. |
| **Step 3a — ROI Path** | User selects ROI Wizard → enters property address/link, purchase price, expected rent, expenses. |
| **Step 3b** | ROI Wizard displays gross yield, net yield, IRR, 5-year cashflow projection, and comparison to Dubai area average. |
| **Step 3c** | User clicks "Generate Investment Summary" → Gemini AI produces a plain-language narrative contextualising the numbers. |
| **Step 4a — Developer Intel Path** | User wants to vet the developer before committing. Opens Prop Pulse → Developer Intelligence. |
| **Step 4b** | User enters developer name (e.g. "Sobha Realty") → Crustdata fetches B2B data → Gemini generates institutional-grade due diligence report with health score and recommendation. |
| **Step 5** | User is prompted to sign up / log in (via Supabase Auth) to save the report and unlock full features. |
| **Step 6** | ROI Wizard surfaces CTA: "View this property in 3D — See exactly what your investment looks like." |
| **Step 7** | If a 3D scan exists: user navigates the 3D space, reads spatial ROI annotations. If not: user sees property images and is told a 3D tour can be requested from the listing broker. |
| **Step 8** | User downloads or shares the cinematic WhatsApp-ready video tour (if available). |
| **Step 9** | User saves/bookmarks property, shares the full report link (ROI + developer intel + 3D tour) with a co-investor. |

### 5.2 Primary Flow — Broker Journey

| Broker Fast-Track Flow | |
|---|---|
| **Step 1** | Broker signs up or logs in via Supabase Auth (email/password or Google OAuth). Broker Pro account verified. |
| **Step 2** | Broker creates a new property listing → enters metadata (address, area, price, bedrooms, sqft). |
| **Step 3** | Broker clicks "Generate Description" → Gemini AI produces a luxury-toned marketing description from the metadata. Broker edits and saves. |
| **Step 4** | Broker uploads 10–30 photos of the property. |
| **Step 5** | Platform generates the Gaussian Splat 3D scene (1–5 minutes processing). Real-time status updates via Supabase real-time. |
| **Step 6** | Broker adds spatial annotations (view value, finish quality, yield hotspots). |
| **Step 7** | Broker runs the ROI Wizard for the property → generates ROI metrics + AI investment narrative to attach to the listing. |
| **Step 8** | Broker clicks "Generate Tour" → system renders a 30-second 1080p MP4 flythrough with broker branding overlay. |
| **Step 9** | Broker downloads the video and shares directly to client WhatsApp group. |
| **Step 10** | Broker shares a viewer link (mobile-optimised) with ROI summary + AI description + 3D tour. |
| **Step 11** | Interested investor clicks the link → sees 3D view + ROI data + description → contacts broker via embedded CTA. |
| **Step 12** | (Optional) Broker uses Developer Intelligence to generate a developer report to share with clients for additional trust-building. |

### 5.3 Alternative Flow — Market Browser

| Market Browser Flow | |
|---|---|
| **Step 1** | User enters via Prop Pulse (Tool 2) — accessible without login (public route). |
| **Step 2** | User filters by area (e.g. Dubai Marina), property type (apartment), price range (AED 1.5M–3M). |
| **Step 3** | User sees a list/map of properties with average yield and price-per-sqft data. |
| **Step 4** | User selects a specific property → sees auto-generated ROI summary. |
| **Step 5** | User navigates to Developer Intelligence tab → enters the property's developer name → receives AI-generated due diligence report. |
| **Step 6** | User is offered 3D Viewer CTA if a 3D scan exists for that property. If no scan exists, user sees property images with a note that 3D tours are available for Broker Pro listings. |
| **Step 7** | User is prompted to sign up to save properties, bookmark reports, and unlock full features. |

### 5.4 Authentication Flow

Authentication is handled entirely by **Supabase Auth** on the frontend using `@supabase/ssr`. There are no backend `/api/auth` endpoints — the backend only validates Supabase JWTs via middleware on protected routes.

| Auth Detail | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Sign up / Login** | Frontend calls `supabase.auth.signUp()` or `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()` via client components. |
| **OAuth** | Google OAuth supported via `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' })`. |
| **Session storage** | HTTP-only cookies managed by `@supabase/ssr` — never `localStorage`. |
| **Route protection** | Next.js `middleware.ts` checks session before allowing access to `(tools)`, `(dashboard)`, `(viewer)` routes. |
| **Backend validation** | Express `authMiddleware` extracts Bearer token from `Authorization` header, calls `supabase.auth.getUser(token)` to validate. |
| **Profile creation** | Auto-created via PostgreSQL trigger (`handle_new_user()`) when a user signs up — no API call needed. |
| **Token refresh** | Handled automatically by `@supabase/ssr` middleware on every request. |

**Access tiers:**

| Tier | Access |
|---|---|
| **Guest (no login)** | Browse landing page, Prop Pulse market data, 3 ROI calculations, 1 Developer Intelligence report (watermarked). |
| **Free registered** | Unlimited ROI calculations, 5 AI descriptions/month, 3 AI narratives/month, save up to 3 properties, view shared 3D links. |
| **Investor (paid)** | All Free features + 10 Developer Intelligence reports/month, generate up to 5 personal 3D tours/month, video export. |
| **Broker Pro (paid)** | All Investor features + unlimited 3D scans, unlimited AI content, white-label video/PDF export, client CRM, priority processing. |
| **Enterprise** | Custom volume pricing, API access, branded landing pages, dedicated support. |

- Price range slider (AED).
- Bedrooms filter (Studio, 1BR, 2BR, 3BR, 4BR+).

#### 6.3.2 Developer Intelligence Reports (Crustdata + Gemini)

This is the **AI-native agency** feature — it replaces what a $500/hour real estate analyst does manually. Users enter a developer name (e.g. Emaar, Sobha, Damac, Nakheel) and receive an institutional-grade due diligence report generated in seconds.

**Data Layer — Crustdata API:**
- **Company profile:** Headcount, founded date, HQ location, LinkedIn URL, website.
- **Growth signals:** Headcount growth over 6/12/24 months — a leading indicator of developer health and expansion.
- **Hiring momentum:** Active job postings count and trend — signals upcoming project launches.
- **Funding & financial health:** Total funding raised, last funding round, investors.
- **Decision-maker contacts:** Key executives (CEO, CFO, Head of Sales) with LinkedIn profiles for broker outreach.
- **Competitive benchmarking:** Compare two developers side-by-side on growth metrics.

**AI Synthesis Layer — Gemini:**
- Crustdata's raw B2B data is fed into Gemini 2.5 Flash with a system instruction to produce an **investment-grade developer assessment**.
- **Output:** A 1–2 page narrative report covering:
  - Developer financial health score (derived from growth signals).
  - Project delivery track record assessment.
  - Workforce momentum analysis (hiring = expansion, layoffs = risk).
  - Key risk factors and red flags.
  - Recommendation: "Strong Buy / Buy / Hold / Caution" rating with justification.
- **Tone:** Institutional analyst briefing — objective, data-driven, no marketing language.
- **Format:** Rendered as a shareable web page with PDF export option.

**Why this is an AI-native agency play:**
- Traditional due diligence on a developer costs AED 5,000–15,000 from a consulting firm and takes 1–2 weeks.
- This platform delivers the same deliverable in 30 seconds for AED 50–200 per report.
- The "finished work" (the report) is what the user pays for — not access to a tool.
- Scale: one backend can serve 10,000 reports/day with zero additional headcount.

**Access:**
- Free tier: 1 report/month (watermarked).
- Investor tier: 10 reports/month.
- Broker Pro: Unlimited reports, white-label PDF with their branding.

#### 6.3.3 Data Outputs

- Average price per sqft by area and bedroom count.
- Average gross rental yield by area.
- Recent transaction volume (last 30, 90, 365 days).
- Supply pipeline: off-plan units expected to complete in next 12/24 months.
- Price trend chart: historical price index over 3/5 years.
- Top-performing areas ranked by yield.

#### 6.3.4 Property Listing Integration

- Optional: Link to live DLD (Dubai Land Department) transaction data feed.
- Property cards with photo, price, beds, sqft, yield, and 3D tour availability badge.
- Map view with heatmap overlay for price/yield intensity by area.

---

### 6.5 AI-Powered Content Generation (Gemini + Crustdata)

The platform integrates Google Gemini AI (`@google/genai` SDK) and Crustdata API to automate content creation and intelligence tasks that would otherwise require expensive human analysts, copywriters, and consultants. This is the core of the **AI-native agency** model — selling finished work (reports, descriptions, narratives) at software margins.

#### 6.5.1 AI Property Description Generator

When a broker or user creates a property listing with basic metadata (address, area, bedrooms, sqft, price, property type), the platform offers a one-click "Generate Description" action powered by Gemini.

- **Input:** Property metadata from the `properties` table (address, area, property_type, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft, price_aed, annual_rent_aed) + optional uploaded photos.
- **Output:** A polished, luxury-toned property description (150–250 words) in English, optimised for WhatsApp sharing and marketing materials.
- **Tone:** Professional Dubai real estate marketing — confident, aspirational, specific to the area and property type.
- **Highlights extraction:** Gemini identifies and emphasises key selling points (view, location, finishes, yield potential) based on the metadata.
- **Editable:** The generated description is presented as a draft that the user can edit before saving.
- **Regenerate:** Users can click "Regenerate" to get an alternative version without re-entering data.
- **Access:** Available to all registered users. Free tier: 5 generations/month. Paid tiers: unlimited.

#### 6.5.2 AI ROI Report Narrative

After the ROI Wizard calculates financial metrics (gross yield, net yield, IRR, cashflow), the platform generates a plain-language investment summary using Gemini.

- **Input:** Calculated ROI metrics from the `roi_calculations` table (purchase_price, annual_rent, gross_yield, net_yield, monthly_cashflow, irr_5yr, irr_10yr, holding_period_years, appreciation_rate_pct) + property area for benchmarking context.
- **Output:** A 2–3 paragraph investment narrative (100–200 words) that contextualises the numbers for a non-technical investor.
- **Content includes:**
  - Whether the yield is above or below the area average.
  - Cashflow timeline — when monthly cashflow turns positive (if mortgaged).
  - Risk factors — sensitivity to vacancy, rate changes.
  - Comparison framing — "This property outperforms X% of similar units in [area]."
- **Shareable:** The narrative is included in the ROI report PDF/link that brokers share with clients.
- **Tone:** Objective and data-driven, not salesy — positioned as an analyst briefing.
- **Access:** Available to all registered users. Free tier: 3 narratives/month. Paid tiers: unlimited.
